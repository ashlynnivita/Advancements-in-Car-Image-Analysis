# Advancements-in-Car-Image-Analysis

The main objective of this study is to utilize machine learning and deep learning techniques to enhance the recognition accuracy of vehicle makes and colors, thereby contributing to improved manufacturing processes and law enforcement efforts. The primary approach employed revolves around the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset for this research has been taken from Kaggle and contains a diverse collection of vehicle images. Additionally, this study makes use of EfficientNetB3, a cutting-edge neural network architecture which enhances the accuracy and
efficiency of vehicle image classification tasks through its optimized depth and width scaling.
